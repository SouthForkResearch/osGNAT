about=The Geomorphic Network and Analysis Toolbox (GNAT) is a set of tools used to generate and analyze network and geomorphic attributes for a spatially-explicit stream network dataset, such as NHD or NWI. GNAT was originally developed to support the geomorphic attribute analysis and modeling efforts of the Integrated Status and Effectiveness Monitoring Program (ISEMP) and Columbia Habitat Monitoring Program (CHaMP). However, the tools found within GNAT are flexible enough to be used in a wide variety of data processing and analysis efforts revolving around stream networks.
